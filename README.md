# Tetris
Tetris (Russian: Тетрис)[a] is a puzzle video game created by the Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1985.[1] It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded the Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing.

# Tetromino
A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally (i.e. at the edges and not the corners).[1][2] Tetrominoes, like dominoes and pentominoes, are a particular type of polyomino. The corresponding polycube, called a tetracube, is a geometric shape composed of four cubes connected orthogonally.

A popular use of tetrominoes is in the video game Tetris created by the Soviet game designer Alexey Pajitnov, which refers to them as tetriminos.[3] The tetrominoes used in the game are specifically the one-sided tetrominoes.
